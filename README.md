# General-Projects

Java projects include high-school swing application projects to simple coding examples on polymorphism and simple data structures. Also included are projects from my Udemy courses that cover sorts, advanced data structures, graph and graph algorithm implementation like Dijkstra's algorithm, BellmanFord, Strongly Connected Components (like Youtube algorithms, although they may use a ML model), a simple cycle detecter that finds a pseudo arbitrage situation in a "Forex Market", a web scraper, a simple client-server demonstration and more. 

The VR projects were highly inefficient in terms of memory, but they are really cool and awesome. Projects include: 
1) Soma Cube Animation (Only MAYA)
2) Principles of Animation (ONLY MAYA)
3) REALLY COOL HELICOPTER (ONLY MAYA)
4) Tank Game Tutorial
5) "Neuromachina" - character rigged and animated, Halo themed, two-player shooter game with powerups
6) "Cooking Dada" - VR cooking tutorial game (credits to Ryosaka for grabber)
**Final Gambit if "Cooking Dada" had failed: a simple but fluid juggling game**

I am working on a profile website using the React framework/library and hope to use some modelling to enhance some animations.
