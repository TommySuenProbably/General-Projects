# General-Projects

***This is the repositiory where I mash all my files if the other repositiories fail to upload.

Some of the Java files are not up to date because the newest versions lie on my school drive, which has been wiped.
However, my fundamental skills and style of coding is clear through the programs. There are many small exercises, but "Anger Birds" was my first encounter using swing applications. I am very proud of that assignment. More evidence for good coding practices can be found in my more recent programs in C++ (GENE121 folder).

For my experience with Android Studio, I simply put images from my presentation. The projects below also require knowledge with apps and Android so if the evidence of the images is insufficient, refer to below.

The VR projects are very inefficient in terms of memory, but they are quite neat. Projects include: 
1) Soma Cube Animation (Only MAYA)
2) Principles of Animation (ONLY MAYA)
3) REALLY COOL HELICOPTER (ONLY MAYA)
4) Tank Game Tutorial
5) "Neuromachina" - character rigged and animated, Halo themed, two-player shooter game with powerups
6) "Cooking Dada" - VR cooking tutorial game (credits to Ryosaka for grabber)
**Final Gambit if "Cooking Dada" had failed: a simple but fluid juggling game**
